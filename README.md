This is a very basic dnd app that I am creating to be a simple and intuitive addition to any dnd game. Right now, it has a dice roller that can simulate any die from a d4 to a d100,
as well as a pseudo coin toss that essentially acts as a d2, displaying heads or tails randomly. It uses the random function and a bit of floor math in js to generate the random
numbers, and some very basic css styling to draw the box and background.

This is a project that I hope will turn larger, eventually turning into a fully fleshed out companion app that can be used to aid with any dnd campaign.
